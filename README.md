# RandCall v4.0
A little project for calling students (showing texts or pictures) randomly.

It will pick up a name in the text file "namelist.txt" and show the image file with the same name if it exists. Else, the name will be shown.

The picture or name will be displayed in a 256x256 window, which means the picture will be scaled and cropped to fill it.

` Attention: images with alpha channel cannot be well display.`
## How to use
- Edit "namelist.txt", and make the names you want in.
- Add image files (*.bmp, *.jpg, *.jpeg and *.png are supported) named correctly to folder "p\\".
- Open RandCall, click the button, and enjoy it!
